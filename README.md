# üõ∞Ô∏è Actoverse

Actoverse is an online debugger suite for the Actor model, which provides a graphical visualization for message timeline, causal-consistent reverse debugging, and some useful features for debugging actors.

**NOTE: This is a client interface of Actoverse protocol and this repository does not include libraries for debugging targets or demo applications. Check [a target API implementation for Scala](https://github.com/45deg/Actoverse-Scala) and [its examples](https://github.com/45deg/Actoverse-Scala-Demos).**

## Features

- Live inspecting states inside actors
- Visualizing the causal flow of messages between actors
- Restore any point of the past state of actors ( _Reverse Debugging_ ) while keeping the causal relationship
- Making breakpoints by the attributes or contents of messages such as:
  + sender / receiver actor's name
  + partial / perfect pattern matching of message data

### Quick start with Scala

Using [Actoverse-Scala](https://github.com/45deg/Actoverse-Scala) for a target.

1. Install scala and sbt. For example in macOS,

```
brew install scala
brew install sbt
```

2. Clone the repository of the demo source. ‚Üí `git clone https://github.com/45deg/Actoverse-Scala-Demos`
3. Execute `sbt run`.
4. Select a example script to run by entering the index of it.
5. Start the Actoverse debugger and input the address `localhost:2000` into the form and push the `Connect` button.
6. Then a time-space diagram will show up.
