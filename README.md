# üõ∞Ô∏è Actoverse

Actoverse is an online debugger suite for the Actor model, which provides a graphical visualization for message timeline, causal-consistent reverse debugging, and some useful features for debugging actors.

**NOTE: This is a client interface of Actoverse protocol and this repository does not include libraries for debugging targets or demo applications. Check [a target API implementation for Scala](https://github.com/45deg/Actoverse-Scala) and [its examples](https://github.com/45deg/Actoverse-Scala-Demos).**
